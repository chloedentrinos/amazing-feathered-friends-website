            1 sample would typically be useful for the general public who want
            to know the sex of their bird. If you want to by a few samples for
            different birds then you are able to by multiple sample 1s.

        </div>
        <div class="col-7">
          <p>
            5 samples would most likely be used for a bird breeder who wants to
            know the sexes of the new generation of baby birds. If a couple more
            samples are needed then some 1 samples can be added on.

        </div>
        <div class="col-7">
          <p>
            10 samples would probably be bought by veterinary personnel who have
            had customers who want their birds' sexes determined. It can be
            combined with other sample amounts if demand is high.
