          <h3>Breeding</h3>
          <p>We have many birds which breed annually, some of which include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Alexandrians,</li>
            <li>Amazons,</li>
            <li>Conures,</li>
            <li>Eclectuses,</li>
            <li>Minature Macaws,</li>
            <li>Malabars,</li>
            <li>Indian Ringnecks, and</li>
            <li>Plumheads.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All birds are hand-raised using specialised rearing formula. They
            are trained up to the point of sale and include an identification
            ring. They are taught how to fly which increases their positive body
            development and we will cut their nails and clip their wings before
            selling them if necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have decided what bird you would like contact us with what
            one you have chosen and we will schedule a time for you to come and
            meet it to make sure you are compatible with each other and that it
            is the one that you want to choose.

          <h3>Boarding</h3>
          <p>
            We board a range of birds over multiple lengths of time. Whether
            you're going out of town for the weekend, going on holidays for a
            couple of weeks, or want your bird to have a vacation for a month,
            we have you covered. We are open to care for any bird without
            discrimination.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can either use a cage that you have provided for your bird or we
            can use one of our spare cages. You can also supply specific food or
            rules for your bird or we can feed it what our birds eat and the
            rules that they live by. We can cut the bird's nails and clip their
            wings if you wish and attempt to train them if you believe that they
            need to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just look at the calendar to see when we are already booked or when
            we are not available so you can decide when will best suit you and
            contact us about what you want.

          <h3>Sexing</h3>
          <p>
            We discover the sex of a range of birds. Whether they are a baby and
            you want to know their gender to be able to name them, or they are
            older and you are just not able to tell, we have you covered. All it
            takes is a small blood sample and some science to discover what the
            bird's gender is.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use PCR, a centrifugal machine and gel electrophoresis in order
            to analyse the DNA and discover the gender. This process can usually
            occur in one day allowing for quicker results sent out. There are
            limited companies doing this type of science in Australia so it is
            one of a kind.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you have decided on what amount of samples best suits you
            contact us and we will give you the information on how we will send
            you the samples and how you can send it back to us once the birds
            DNA is on them.
