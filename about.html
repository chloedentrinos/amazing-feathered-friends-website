        <h3>Who Are We?</h3>
        <p>
          We are a small family who's lives revolve around our birds. It has all
          started from one bird and has evolved into an unimaginable small
          business. Over the years we have gained a variety of birds through
          purposeful and accidental means. Whether its because we want or need
          them, or because they have been neglected or injured, we open our arms
          and make them one of our own.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What Do We Do?</h3>
        <p>
          We hand-raise birds from when they are babies, we look after peoples'
          birds when they are unable to do so, and we discover the gender of
          birds using science. We have invested in an enclosed trailer which we
          have set up into a lab so we are able to perform the necessary
          science. As well as all of these services, we are still able to
          maintain the wellbeing of our own birds and any additional birds that
          we acquire.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Why Do We Do It?</h3>
        <p>
          We are dedicated to our birds and want to spread our abilities to
          others. We want to give all birds the best opportunity possible and
          want to make sure that people are paired with the most suitable bird.
          If birds are unable to be cared for by their owners, we want to make
          sure that they are with people who will care for them, rather than
          letting them fend for themselves. Rather than having people guess a
          bird's gender wrong, we want to provide the owner with what it is
          before people assume it. These will hopefully give both the birds and
          the owners the best experience possible with their new lives together.

          addition to our family. You have provided so much information on
          having a bird you have made the transition from a golden retriever to
          a parrot very easy. So glad I got Maxie from you guys."
